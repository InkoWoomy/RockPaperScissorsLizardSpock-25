Review: Really nice and compact! the design is visually appealing and the game runs perfectly. my only complaint is that I wish there was a way to tell the score besides counting in your head,
besides that, Good Job! 


This project lets you play RPSLS in either 2 player mode or against a computer player. AN API is used to give a computer selection so the player can play against it.
